# intern-july-2024
On this occasion, I had the opportunity to be in charge of the July 2024 internship program. Interestingly, the intern students are students who do not have a computer science background. With the help of my partner, Dr.Eng. Garcia, this material became an interesting basis for learning.

We gave 3 scenarios for the interns to collect and process data by using FonLog.
The 3 scenarios are:

1. Text, we collect data from patients such as body temperature, by inputting text into FonLog
2. Emotion, we collect the emotions of the patient by choosing the list of options.
3. Activity, we labeling the activity and record it.

After having data from their daily activity, we process the data to get any knowledge from it.
